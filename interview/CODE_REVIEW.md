## Overview
This document identifies problems, security issues, and areas for improvement in the Feedback System application.

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES

### Backend

#### 1. **Hardcoded Secret Key (HIGH SECURITY RISK)**
**File:** `backend/app/auth.py` (Line 13)
```python
SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key-here-change-in-production"
```
**Problem:** Secret key is hardcoded and exposed in source control. Anyone with access to the code can forge JWT tokens.

**Impact:** 
- Attackers can create valid JWT tokens
- User authentication can be completely bypassed
- No way to rotate keys without code changes

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

---

#### 2. **No Environment Variable Configuration**
**Files:** 
- `backend/app/auth.py` (Lines 13-15)
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` (Line 10)
- `frontend/src/services/auth.ts` (Line 3)

**Problem:** All configuration values are hardcoded (SECRET_KEY, API URLs, token expiry, CORS origins).

**Impact:**
- Can't deploy to different environments
- Security credentials in source control
- Can't change configuration without rebuilding

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

---

#### 3. **Deprecated datetime.utcnow() Usage**
**File:** `backend/app/auth.py` (Lines 64, 66)
```python
expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES)
```
**Problem:** `datetime.utcnow()` is deprecated in Python 3.12+ and doesn't include timezone info.

**Impact:**
- Will break in future Python versions
- Potential timezone-related bugs

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

#### 4. **No Rate Limiting**
**File:** `backend/app/main.py` (All endpoints)

**Problem:** No rate limiting on any endpoint including auth endpoints.

**Impact:**
- Vulnerable to brute force attacks on login
- API can be easily DDoS'd
- No protection against spam feedback submissions

**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH

---

#### 5. **Weak Password Validation**
**File:** `backend/app/schemas.py` (Would need to check)

**Problem:** No server-side password strength validation beyond minimum length in frontend.

**Impact:**
- Users can set weak passwords
- Vulnerable to credential stuffing
- No enforcement of password complexity

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

#### 6. **Overly Permissive CORS Configuration**
**File:** `backend/app/main.py` (Lines 22-31)
```python
allow_methods=["*"],
allow_headers=["*"],
```
**Problem:** Allows all HTTP methods and headers from specified origins.

**Impact:**
- Unnecessarily broad attack surface
- Could enable unexpected API usage

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

#### 7. **No Pagination Validation**
**File:** `backend/app/main.py` (Lines 153, 191, 202)
```python
def read_feedback_list(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100, ...):
```
**Problem:** No maximum limit validation. Client can request `limit=999999999`.

**Impact:**
- Memory exhaustion attacks
- Database performance issues
- Server crashes

**Priority:** 🟠 HIGH

---

#### 8. **No Database Transaction Error Handling**
**File:** `backend/app/crud.py` (Multiple functions)

**Problem:** No try-except blocks for database operations. Errors bubble up as 500.

**Impact:**
- Poor user experience
- No rollback on partial failures
- Leaks implementation details in errors

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

#### 9. **No Logging/Monitoring**
**Files:** All backend files

**Problem:** No structured logging of errors, auth attempts, or suspicious activity.

**Impact:**
- Can't debug production issues
- Can't detect security breaches
- No audit trail

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

#### 10. **Upvote Count Inconsistency Risk**
**File:** `backend/app/crud.py` (Lines 198-211)

**Problem:** Upvote count is manually incremented/decremented instead of being computed from Upvote table.

**Impact:**
- Count can drift from reality due to bugs
- No single source of truth
- Hard to fix if inconsistency occurs

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

### Frontend

#### 1. **Hardcoded API Base URL**
**Files:**
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` (Line 10)
- `frontend/src/services/auth.ts` (Line 3)

```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000";
```
**Problem:** API URL is hardcoded. Can't deploy to production or different environments.

**Impact:**
- Build needs modification for each environment
- No way to use proxy in development
- Breaking changes require code changes

**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH

---

#### 2. **Debug Code Left in Production**
**File:** `frontend/src/components/FeedbackList.tsx` (Line 86)
```typescript
<h2>Feedback Entries ({sortedFeedbacks.length}) - Renders: {renderCount}</h2>
```
**Problem:** Render count debug info exposed to users.

**Impact:**
- Unprofessional appearance
- Leaks implementation details
- Confusion for users

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW

---

#### 3. **Broken SPA Redirect Logic**
**File:** `frontend/src/services/api.ts` (Line 41)
```typescript
window.location.href = "/login";
```
**Problem:** Tries to redirect to `/login` route which doesn't exist in this SPA.

**Impact:**
- 404 error on token expiry
- Poor user experience
- App breaks on auth failure

**Priority:** 🟠 HIGH

---

#### 4. **No localStorage Availability Check**
**Files:**
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` (Line 23)
- `frontend/src/services/auth.ts` (Line 10, 84)

**Problem:** Uses localStorage without checking if it's available (private browsing, old browsers).

**Impact:**
- App crashes in private browsing mode
- Breaks in environments without localStorage
- No fallback mechanism

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

#### 5. **Missing Upvote Visual Feedback**
**File:** `frontend/src/components/FeedbackList.tsx` (Lines 110-116)

**Problem:** Backend returns `has_upvoted` field but UI doesn't use it to show if user has upvoted.

**Impact:**
- User can't tell if they've already upvoted
- Confusing UX
- API data not fully utilized

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

#### 6. **No Error Boundaries**
**Files:** All component files

**Problem:** No React error boundaries to catch component errors.

**Impact:**
- Entire app crashes on component error
- White screen of death
- No graceful degradation

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

#### 7. **No Request Retry Logic**
**File:** `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

**Problem:** Failed requests aren't retried automatically for transient failures.

**Impact:**
- Poor UX on temporary network issues
- Users see errors for recoverable failures
- More support tickets

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW

---

#### 8. **No Optimistic Updates**
**File:** `frontend/src/App.tsx` (Line 58-73)

**Problem:** Upvotes don't update UI immediately (no optimistic update).

**Impact:**
- UI feels slow and unresponsive
- Poor user experience
- Doesn't match modern app expectations

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

#### 9. **Weak Client-Side Validation**
**Files:** 
- `frontend/src/components/RegisterForm.tsx` (Line 26)
- `frontend/src/components/FeedbackForm.tsx`

**Problem:** Minimal real-time validation feedback as user types.

**Impact:**
- User only sees errors on submit
- Poor form UX
- More failed submissions

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW

---

#### 10. **Token Expiry Not Handled Gracefully**
**File:** `frontend/src/services/api.ts` (Lines 35-44)

**Problem:** On 401, immediately removes token and redirects. No refresh token mechanism.

**Impact:**
- User logged out abruptly mid-session
- Work can be lost
- No warning before session expiry

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---
